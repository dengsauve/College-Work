# 5.	IF there is no solution, then print an appropriate message and re-display the menu



# There are 10 mazes provided called "maze1.mz" through "maze10.mz" which you can use to test your solution.
# Your main program should show a menu to the user to allow them to select a particular maze to solve.

# A short description of the algorithm as well as the mazes are provided in an attachment here.
