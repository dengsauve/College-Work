# Project: Website Creation

Design a complete HTML5 website for any business that you like that is appropriate for class.
The site must be styled correctly – spelling is important!

##### You are required to use the primary HTML5 Structural Elements:
- \<header>
- \<nav>
- \<section>
- \<article>
- \<footer>

##### The site must contain the following separate pages:

Global Navigation | URL
---|---
Contact Us | contactus.html
Products | /products.html
Blog | /blog.html
Calendar | /calendar.html
Maps | /maps.html
Preferences | /preferences.html
Login/Logout | /login.html

- [x] Design your navigation using buttons, or graphics, with rollovers as appropriate.
- [x] Create your CSS for your entire site in an external file that is to be stored in a folder called “css”
- [x] Create all of your images in a folder called “images” with appropriate paths to this folder.
- [x] Create an empty folder called “js”
- [ ] Create “Lorem Ipsum” type placement files for each of the various representative page. There should be NO 404 pages, ie. No links that don’t resolve to a webpage.

#### VALIDATE YOUR ENTIRE SITE both HTML and CSS.

##### Upload the files you created from Website Creation to Dreamhost in your production environment.
