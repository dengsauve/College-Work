Ruby II – CIS 283

Character Play Off – Multiple Classes

Create a game that will allow 2 different fictional characters to face off against each other in a simulated environment.
Please use my attributes exactly – this is MY game, not yours.

This program should have the following classes:
[X]Character Class
	[X]Maximum values should be class variables and should  be checked on input
	[X]Attributes:
	    [ ]Name,
	    [ ]Race,
		[ ]Hit Points (Max 100),
		[ ]Current hit points (calculated)
		[ ]Strength (Max 50),
		[ ]Agility (Max 10),
		[ ]Weapon,   (object from the Weapon Class)
		[ ]Armor  (object from the Armor Class)
	Methods:
	    [ ]to_s – to print out details about the character
		[ ]current_status   - print out the current status of this character
		[ ]revive_character – resets character's current_hits to original hits
		[ ]reduce_hits   (removes some # of hits from the character)

[X]Dice Class
	[ ]Attributes:
	    [ ]sides_of_die
	Methods:
	    [ ]initialize(  num_sides )
		[ ]roll  (returns a random number between 1 and num_sides )

[X]Item Class
	[ ]Attributes:
	    [ ]name

[X]Weapons Class - which inherits from Item class
	[ ]Attributes:
	    [ ]damage_hits
	Methods:
	    [ ]to_s

[X]Armor Class - which inherits from Item class
	[ ]Attributes:
	    [ ]protection_hits
	Methods:
	    [ ]to_s


[ ]Your program will load 2 different characters into your game from a text file which describes each character like this
    3 lines of information representing the character, weapon, and armor.  Each character has their own text file.
	Dave, elf, 47, 30, 10		#Name, race, hits, strength, agility	turn into a Character Object
	Bow, 15			#name, hits   turn into a Weapon Object
	Leather, 10			#name, hits   turn into an Armor Object

[X]Create a menu exactly like this:
    Load Character 1
    Load Character 2
    Fight
    Quit

Loading the character will create the appropriate class objects for a character, the armor and weapon that this character uses.

Fighting will simulate the fighting with rounds of fighting using the following assumptions, printing the status of each step:

Loop fighting until one character has lost all of their hit points

For each fighter
    [ ]First roll an AGILE sided die for each fighter to determine which fighter goes first.
        [ ]The fighter with the highest score will go first.

    [ ]Roll a 10-sided die to determine if the fighter hits or misses
        [ ]The equation would be:  roll10 < agility is a hit otherwise a miss.

    A hits damage is determined by the character's strength and weapon's power with this formula:
        [ ]hit = (strength * (1.0/roll4) + (weapon hits)/roll8)  (as an integer)

    This is then reduced by an armor save from the formula:
        [ ]armor_save = (opponent's armor hits / roll15 ) (as an integer)

    Reduce the opponent's current_hits by the (hit – armor_save) amount (Don't reduce by negative numbers
End fighting loop (now do the opponent)

[ ]PAUSE after each round

[ ]Print out the winner and both fighter's statistics

A rollN is a roll of an N-sided die.
So a roll7 would be a roll of a 7 sided die numbered 1-7.
For this program you will need to create 6 different Dice objects:
    [ ]a Dagile for each character,
    [ ]D4,
    [ ]D5,
    [ ]D8,
    [ ]D10,
    [ ]D15


A typical fight scenario will look like this:

Legolas greenleaf fights with the Bow:
  	Hit: 31    Gimli's armor saved 8 points

Gimli fights with the axe:
  	Misses!
