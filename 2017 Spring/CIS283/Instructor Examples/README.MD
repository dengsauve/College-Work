# Ruby II
### Dave Jones Instructing
#### Last Project: Character Playoff

## About
Dave told me jokingly (or not) that the difference between Ruby I and Ruby II was going to be 'pain'.

## Projects

* **Enrollment Program:** Parses raw enrollment text data to extract user prompted classes
* **Blizzard Errors:** A program that parses XML files for their unique data (id# and error message) and stores it in an object, which can then recreate the XML tag as a string.
* **Vending Machine (Incomplete):** A program that parallels our Jukebox project; mimicking a vending machine using classes to represent the vending machine, and the sodas, candies, etc.
* **Jukebox Machine:** A program that reads song data from text, converts to a song object, and adds them to the Jukebox object that is created after.
* **Character Playoff (In Progress):** This is a program that emulates turn-based character combat, as in a traditional RPG, dice and all.
