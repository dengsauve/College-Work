              My collection of professional and academic projects,
              as well as a comprehensive list of accomplishments, work
              experience, education, skils, and awards. In addition, I have fleshed out
              in detail past tests I have taken as well as contracted projects.

              Born and raised in the beautiful city of Spokane, WA, I have
              developed an appreciation for the outdoors that surrounds us. I
              could not imagine living anywhere else.<br /><br />My primary
              coding skillset lays in utility scripting with Python and Bash, as
              well as backend webpage scripting with PHP and MySQL. I am
              currently enrolled at Spokane Community College to improve my
              front-end development prowess (this page is a result of one
              quarter's knowledge) as well as my mobile design abilities.<br />
              <br />In my spare time I fly quadcopters, and take interstate
              motorcycle trips when I have the time and when the roads aren't
              icy.
