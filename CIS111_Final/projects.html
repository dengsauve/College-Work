        <p class='projects'>
          My 'Baptism by Fire' into the corporate world, this job is singlehandedly the most valuable experience
          of my career so far. I learned the linux command line and how to edit files without the use of a mouse.
          I also learned how to assemble and setup server racks, and run cables between switches, digiports, and the
          server blades themselves. I created a new front end webpage for the lab reservation database, which allowed
          employees to check out server blades for use. I developed and deployed a power saving program that checked
          the power status of a given blade via the APS api against the reservation status in the database. If the blade
          was on but not checked out, at noon it was shutoff. This also lead the creation of Larson (Lab Reservation System Navigator).
          This was an interactive command-line linux script that reported data about reservations, power statuses, and more from the
          database and APS units.
