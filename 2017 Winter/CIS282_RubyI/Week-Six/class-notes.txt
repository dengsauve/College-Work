Turns out the exclamation point has a purpose

example - delete! will modify the string in place (the variable itself)
whereas - delete will simply return a modified string, leaving the original variable alone

In a way, it's kind of elegant. Adding the exclamation point almost says "Hey! Listen!" and draws your attention
to the fact that bad things might happen.
